I created this configurator because I had a heck of a time getting a BTT SKR PRO board to function and I figured a tool made to create configuration files for OnStepx would be useful.
I have created save, load and fetch from Github functionality. I would like to create a github repository of working configuration files to simplify the setup process. Currently I have my config file uploaded to my github. If you create one, let me know and I will add it to the preset folder on the repository. 
Let me know if there is anything that needs to be changed and how it's working for you.
